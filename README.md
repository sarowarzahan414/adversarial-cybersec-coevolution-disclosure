## Purpose

This repository establishes **prior art** for adversarial co-evolutionary reinforcement learning applied to autonomous cybersecurity testing.

By publishing this disclosure, third parties are **prevented from patenting** the disclosed concepts.

---

## Innovation Summary

**First system combining:**
- Adversarial self-play (Red Team vs Blue Team RL agents)
- Cybersecurity orchestration (autonomous pentesting + threat detection)
- Emergent strategy discovery (agents learn novel attacks/defenses)

**Key Innovation:**
Application of AlphaGo-style self-play to Cybersecurity domain, where:
- **Red Agent:** Learns offensive techniques autonomously
- **Blue Agent:** Learns defensive strategies against unseen attacks
- **Co-evolution:** Both improve through competitive pressure over 1M+ episodes
